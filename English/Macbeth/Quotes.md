clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather 
The multitudinous seas incarnadine, 
Making the green one red.

thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?
What's done cannot be undone.
```

Out, out, brief candle. 
Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player 
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, 
And then is heard no more. It is a tale 
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, 
Signifying nothing.
```
~ Macbeth
