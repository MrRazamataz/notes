#### AID:
##### Dharavi housing redevelopment:
* Bottom up approach = high rise towers which maintain the sense of community by having a walk way that connect the different buildings, corridors which allow people to socilaise, areas for people to gather and children to play. Flats have kitchens and toilets.
* Top down approach = People are moved out of Dharavi. Flats are shared between 2 families. Flats have kitchens and toilets. Safer than living on the street but they are an hour away from Dharavi, which causes them to lose the sense of community, plus involves long commute if they work back in the city.
* Small scale NGO (Non-governmental organization) = Sanitation, clean water and electricity are added retrospective to Dharavi. Maintains sense of community, improved quality of life/standard of living. It is expensive and small scale. Street space is reduced, but it is already limited.

#### Tourism case study - Halong Bay:
* Every year, 5.5 million tourists vising Halong Bay in the Guld of Tonkin.
* Tourism creates a positive multiplier effect:
```
Tourists spend money in shops/services, this increases the local demand for goods/services so local suppliers (farmers/fishermen/businesses) make more money. These people pay tax so the local & national government’s tax revenue increases. More demands means more jobs are created, so again more tax & more money in the local economy. This increased tax revenue can be used to build more schools, hospitals & improve the infrastructure in the area.
```
