## Waves  
* Waves transfer energy from one place to another without transferring any matter.  

### Transverse waves:  
* Vibrations (oscillations) are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer.
* *Most* waves are transverse, eg: All electromagnetic waves (light, etc), Ripples and waves in water and a wave on a string.  

### Longitudinal waves:
* Parallel vibrations (parallel to the direction of energy transfer).
* Eg of longitudinal waves: Sound waves in ait (eg, ultrasound), Shock waves (eg, some seismic waves).  


### Wavespeed equation:
`wave speed = frequency x wavelength.`

### Reflection of Waves:  
* All waves can be absorbed, transmitted or reflected.  

#### Ray diagram for reflection:

##### Equation:
`Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection`


### Electromagnetic Waves and Refraction:  
* Are all transverse waves.  
* Travel at same speed through air or a vacuum.

* They have different properties which means they are used for different things (see below).  

#### Uses:  

##### Microwaves:
* Used by satellites.
* Pass easily through the Earth's watery atmosphere.
* Microwave ovens.

##### Infrared Radiation:
* Increase or monitor temperature.
* IR radiation is given out by all hot objects, the hotter the more (I give out tons).

##### Fibre optic cables:  
* Uses visible light to transmit data.
* Uses reflection.

##### Ultraviolet Radiation:
* Can give you a suntan.

##### X-rays and Gamma rays:
* Used in medicine as tracer.


### Dangers of EM waves:  

#### Some can be harmful to people
* When EM radiation enters a living tissue it's often harmless, but sometimes it creates havoc.
* Low frequency waves, dont do much.
* High frequency waves like UV, X-rays and gamma rays all transfer lots of energy and can cause lots of damage.
* UV radiation damages surface cells, which can lead to sunburn and cause skin to age prematurely. Some serious effects are blindness and an increased risk of skin cancer.
* X-rays and gamma rays are types of ionising radiation. Can cause cell destruction or gene mutation, and cancer.
* **Risk is measured in Sieverts**.
