## Methods

### Soliloquy:
Soliloquies are used as a device in drama to let a character make their thoughts known to the audience, address it directly or take it into their confidence.

### Dramatic Irony:
Where the audience is aware of something that some of the characters in the story are unaware of.

### Aside:
Where the character speaks to the audience.

### Rhyming Couplets:
For eg: `Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell.`

### Suspense:
* Shakespeare leaves the audience in little doubt it's going to be a tragedy.

### Poetry:
* The witches always speak in rhymes.
* Emphasises the fact that they are different to the other characters (they exist outside the natural order of the world, so they speak unnaturally).

## Imagery:
### Nature:
* Represents the correct order of the world.
* The horses have "turned wild in nature"

### Health and Disease:
* Represents the state of Scotland under Macbeth's rule.

### Blood + water:
* Symbolises guilt and innocence.
* blood stained daggers
* neuptunes blue ocean washing guilt from Macbeth's hands

### Masculinity:
* Represents aggression and courage and violence.

### Everyday life can be disrupted by guilt:
* Macbeth has killed sleep and they can no longer sleep without issues.
* "Wicked dreams" after killing Duncan
* Lady Macbeth sleepwalks and talks about her guilt.


## Themes:
### Ambition:
* Macbeth's "fatal flaw". Starts off braze, Duncan calls him "noble" and Lady Macbeth says he "wouldst not play false" to get what he wants.
* Initial reluctance to kill Duncan shows hes moral
* His ambition makes him act against his better judgement. The downfall "o'erleaps itself" (his ambition)

### Loyalty:
* Macduff is loyal to Scotland (country)
* Thanes should be loyal to the kings (king)
* Banquo is loyal to his own sense of honour (beliefs)

Loyalty is rewarded and betrayal is punished. The Macbeths pretend to be loyal.
