## Variation:

### Organisms of the same species have differnces:

A cat looks different to a duck because they are different species.
Orangisms of the same species will usually look at *least* slightly different. For eg, hair and eye colour.
These differnces are called variation.

### Types of variation:

#### Genetic Variation:
	
	* Simular to parents in some way because an organim's characteristics are determined by the genes inherited from their parents.
	* The genes are passed on in sex cells (gametes) and the offspring developes from there.
	* This combining causes genetic variation where no 2 of the same species are genetically identical (other than identical twins)
	* Some characteristics are determined only by genes, like eye/hair colour and inhertied disorders like cystic fibrosis.



* Enviromental Variation
