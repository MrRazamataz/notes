## Basics:

* The play is set in 1912 (Edwardian England).


## Typical questions that come up:

### "How far does Priestley present male characters as irresponsible in the play?"
* Ideas:
```
Priestley presents male characters as irresponsible multiple times throughout the play.
He shows that Eric and Gerald recognise by the end of the play that they did wrong (Eric more so).
However, throughout the whole play, Eric is drunk and continues to become more drunk. This shows that even though he realises that what he did with Eva/Daisy was wrong, he still doesn't take control of his drinking, which is allegedly what caused him to get involved with Eva.
At the start of the play, Priestley presents Mr Birling as being obnoxious and pompous in the way that he treated Eva Smith and the way that he is talking to the Inspector. Same goes for Gerald with Eva Smith. This plays into the social class, as they think this is ok for them to do.
```

### "How does Priestley present selfishness and it's effects in An Inspector Calls?"
* Ideas:
```
Shelia's behaviour in Millward's towards Eva Smith.
Mr Birlings attitudes to his workers and their pay specifically.
How characters react to the awareness of their selfishness.
How socialism could be used as an "antidote" for selfishness.
```

### "How does Priestley present Shelia as a character who learns important lessons about herself and society?"
