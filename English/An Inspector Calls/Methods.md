## Methods:

### Characters as symbols:  
* Mr Birling - represents lower middle class, capitalist men
* Mrs Birling - represents upper middle class women
* Shelia - represents middle class women and hope of new generation
* Eric - middle class men and younger generation
* Gerald - upper class man
* Eva Smith - double vulnerability of working class and women

Priestley makes us dislike the characters to persuade us to be on the socialist side, and have people who are capitalist check their morals  

### Entrances and exits:
* Inspector - Interrupts Mr Birlings who is giving a speech explaining his capitalist values.
* Inspector - Exit - Heighted drama with the climatic final speech of "fire and blood and anguish".

### Cyclical Structure:   
At the start of the paly, an Inspector arrives saying a girl has died by drinking disinfectant.   
At the end of the play, there is a phone call informing the household that a young girl has died of drinking disinfectant.

### Contrast and Conflict:
* Between younger and older generations of the family.
