## Density:  

### Equation:
![](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/images/density-formula.png)

* The density of an objects depends on what it's made of and how it's particles are arranged. 

| Density:      | Info: |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Dense      | Particles tightly packed |
| Less dense   | More spread out - easier to compress |

### States of matter:  

States of matter have different densities, who'd of thought...

| State:      | Info: |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Solids      | Strong forces of attraction (*me with ur mum*) that hold the particles together in a fied, regular arrangement. Not much energy; only vibrate in fixed positions. *Genreally*, highest density.|
| Liquids     | Weaker forces of attraction. Particles close together but can move past each other (from **irregular** arrangements). More energy that solids; move random directions at low speeds. *Genreally*, less dense than solids |
| Gas         | *Almost* no forces of attraction. Particles have more energy. Free to move; they travel in random directions at ***high speeds*** . *Genreally*, less dense then liquids.

### Measuring Density:

#### Solid object:
* Same as the guy who put a fake gold crown in the bath and ran around naked...

* Plonk the object into a eureka can and watch the water go brr

#### Liquid (object?):  

1. Pour 10ml of liquid into the measuing cylinder. 
2. Do it again. Repeat until full, recording the total volume and mass each time.
3. For each measurement, use the formula to find the density (btw, 1ml = 1cm^3)
4. Take an averag. wow, done
