## 1.6 Ethics n that  

### Ethics:  

#### Data security:
Personal data is precious and needs to be kept safe. Unfortunately, there are people that attempt to hack systems in order to gain access to other people's data. Social media accounts, phone mailboxes and networks that computers connect to are all prone to hacking.

Some people may also use malware to obtain data. Recent times have seen the increased use of a type of malware known as ransomware. People who write ransomware do it to extort money from unsuspecting users. Once the ransomware infects a computer it encrypts data on it, denying users access unless a ransom is paid.

#### Ensuring public safety:
Ensuring public safety is paramount. As new technologies are introduced, they bring safety concerns.

For example, driverless cars may soon be on the roads in the UK. The designers of driverless cars have not only had to ensure the safety of passengers, but also of other drivers and pedestrians. Ethics apply here as a situation may occur where the car's software has to decide who has safety priority, the passengers or other road users.
