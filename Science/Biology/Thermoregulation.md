## Thermoregulation:

### The tempreture of the body should be constant at around 37Â° C.  

To do this, the body has to balance the amount of energy gained, through, for eg, respiration and the amount lost.

In the brain there are receptors that check the blood temp. This is called the **thermoregulatory centre** in the **brain**.

The thermoregulatory centre also receives impulses from temp receptors in the skin with info on skin temp.

### How the body alters temperature:

#### When the body is too hot:

* Sweat is produced and evaporates from the skin. This transfers energy to the enviroment.  
* The blood vessels dilate to allow blood to flow closer to the surface of the skin. This is called **vasodilation**.

#### When the body is too cold:  

* Hairs on the skin stand on end creating a layer of trapped air.
* No sweat is produced so no energy is lost to the enviroment.
* The blood vessels contrict to close off the skins blood supply. This is called **vasoconstriction**.
* The body may shiver; this makes the muscles contract and needs respiration which transfers some energy to warm the body.
