* Compares pairs of items

__Steps:__

1. Look at the first two items in the list.
2. If they're in the right order, you don't have to do anything.
3. Move on to the next pair of items (the 2nd and 3rd entries) and repeat step 2.
4. Repeat step 3 until you get to the end of the list - this is called one "pass". The last item will now be in the correct place, so don't include it in the next pass.
5. Repeat steps 1 - 4 until there are no swaps in a pass.
