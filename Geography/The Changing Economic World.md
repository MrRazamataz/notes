## The Changing Economic World:  

### Urbanisation:  
* Urbanisation is the growth in the proportion of people living in urban areas.  
* Urbanisation is happening the fastest in poorer countries.  
* Upwards of 55% of the world lives in urban areas, this increases constantly.

### Rate:
* HICs are more economically developed and so most HICs have already experienced urbanisation so around 80% of the population live in urban areas. People leave urban areas for less crowded, rural areas (rate of urbanisation is low).
* LICs are less economically developed. Only around 30% of the population live in urban areas, but have a high rate of urbanisation.
* NEEs are developing economically quickly. The urban population is around 50%+ and the rate of urbanisation is *typically* around 2%.

### Push and Pull factors for Rural-Urban Migration:  
#### Pull:  
* There are more jobs in urban areas that are often better paid.
* Better access to healthcare.
* More educational opportunities.
* Possible quality of life increases.

### Reducing the development gap:
* [Aid (top down & bottom up)](https://github.com/MrRazamataz/notes/blob/main/Geography/Urban%20Issues.md#aid)
* Intermediate technology
* Debt relief
* Micro-finance
* Fair Trade
* Tourism
* Industrial development

### Measuring the development gap:
* Gross National Income (GNI) per head: Total money earned. GNI per head is equal to the GNI divided by the country's population.  
* Infant mortality rate (before age of 1). per 1000
* Access to safe water (%)
* Human development Index (HDI): Combines different measures like education, healthcare, income, life expectancy and others. Ranges from 0 to 1.
* Literacy rate (%).
* People per doctor: population/doctors
* Life expectancy
* Birth and death rates, per 1000.

### Causes of uneven development:
* Bad trade links/geographic position
* Export primary production for less (not processed)
* High national debt

### Consequences of uneven development:
* International migration
* Income - In 2017, Malawi's GNI per capita was $338. In the USA, it was $59,530 (176x higher).
* Health - In Malawi, the infant mortality rate is 35 per 1,000 births. In the UK it is 4. So almost 10x as many babies die before age 1 in Malawi.
Life expectancy is 81 in the UK and 63 in Malawi.
