## Rivers:

### Types of erosion:

#### Hydraulic action:
* The sheer force of the river causing the bed and banks to erode.

#### Abrasion:
* Material carried by the river erodes, scraping along the bed and the banks.

#### Attrition:
* Erorded material carried by the river hits into each other, breaking down into smaller pieces.

#### Corrosion:
* The acids in the water causing erosion.
