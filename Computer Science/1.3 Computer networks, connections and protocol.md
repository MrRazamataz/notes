## 1.3 Computer networks, connections and protocols

## Lan:  

### Describe a LAN Network:
Computers connected in a network at the same geological. Connected with Ethernet/UTP/twisted pair/copper/fibre optic or wirelessly.

### Advantages/Disadvantages of a LAN network over a standalone computer:
* **Advantage:** It can be used to easily share files locally like in a work or an office enviroment.
* **Disadvantage:** If the server with the files on goes offline, then noone can access their files until it is online once more.

### Factors that can effect the performance of a network:
* **Number of users:** The more users that try to access a network, the more "umpfff" is needed to sustain that network.
* **Error rate:** If the network has alot of errors in normal operation, then it can reduce the performance as stuff doesn't work and users can try to "fix" the issue themselves, causing more strain. For example, spam refreshing the page.
* **Transmission media:** The greater the number of devices connected to a network, the more important the choice of transmission medium becomes. *[source](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zvspfcw/revision/8)*
* **Bandwidth:** More bandwith is needed as more infomation is sent to and from the network. For example, having more users on a network would require a higher bandwith so not to bring the network speed down to a crawl.
* **Latency:**
