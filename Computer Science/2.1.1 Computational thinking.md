## 2.1.1 Computational Thinking:

### Abstraction:  
* Filtering out all the garbage.
* Helps to create a general idea of what the problem is and how to solve it

### Decomposistion:  
* Breaking down a more complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts.

### Algorithmic Thinking:  
* A logical way of getting from the problem to the solution.
