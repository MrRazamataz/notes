## Titration

* Used to find out concentrations.


### Steps:
* Put a set amount of alkali (or whatever you want to find the concentration of) in a conical flask along with an indicator.
* Use a funnel to fill a burette with some acid with a known concentration.
* Add the acid to the alkali slowly, a bit at a time. Swirl the conical flask as you do so.  
* When the indicator changes colour, stop and measure the volume of the acid that you needed to put in to neutralise it.  
* Calculate the volume of acid used to neutralise the acid.
