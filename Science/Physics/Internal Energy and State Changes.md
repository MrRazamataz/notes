## Density:  

* The density of an objects depends on what it's made of and how it's particles are arranged. 

| Density:      | Info: |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Dense      | Particles tightly packed |
| Less dense   | More spread out - easier to compress |

### States of matter:  

States of matter have different densities, who'd of thought...

| State:      | Info: |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Solids      | Strong forces of attraction (*me with ur mum*) that hold the particles together in a fied, regular arrangement. Not much energy; only vibrate in fixed positions. *Genreally*, highest density.|
| Liquids     | Weaker forces of attraction. Particles close together but can move past each other (from **irregular** arrangements). More energy that solids; move random directions at low speeds. *Genreally*, less dense than solids |
| Gas         | *Almost* no forces of attraction. Particles have more energy. Free to move; they travel in random directions at ***high speeds*** . *Genreally*, less dense then liquids.
