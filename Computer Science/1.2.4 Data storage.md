## 1.2.4 Data storage:

### Images:
* Stored as a series of pixels.
* Colour of each pixel is a binary code.

* Increasing colour depth and resolution increases the file size.
##### Work out how many colours can be made:
```
Total number of colours = 2^n(where n = number of bits per pixel, or bpp)
```
##### Work out how many bits an image will take up:
```
File size (in bits) = image resolution * colour depth = width * height * colour depth
```

### Sound:
* Sound is sampled and stored digitally.

##### The size of a sound file using this formula:
```
File size (in bits) = Sample rate (in Hz) * bit depth * duration (in seconds)
```
