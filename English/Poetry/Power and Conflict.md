## London - William Blake:
### Context:

* Rejected organised religion

### Form and structure:
* Strict "ABAB" rhyming structure makes poem sound "song like"
* 4 stanzas each show a snapshot of different people in the city

### Language:
* Repetition of "Chartered" (owned)
* Negative words like "woe", "fear", "cry"; all things I do whilst learning poetry
* Metaphors - "Mind-forged manacles"; who knows at this point..
* Oxy**moron**, for eg "marriage hearse"
* Violent imagery like "runs in blood" and "blights with plagues"

## Remains - Simon Armitage:
### Context:
* PTSD
* Modern conflict in "3rd world countries"

### Form and structure:
* SIKE like structure, "end of story, not really"
* First person narrative, telling us something

### Language:
* Juxtaposition of the horror of war with the every day "Dream (pog?) - and he's torn apart"
* Use of an anecdote and prosaic (everyday language) "legs it up the road"; talks like a chad innit
* Alot, like alot, of blood. "His bloody life in my bloody hands"

## Ozymandias - Percy Bysshe Shelley:
