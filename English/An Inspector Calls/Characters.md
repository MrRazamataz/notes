## Characters:  

### The Inspector:  
#### Entrance and Exit:
* He arrives unexpectedly, interrupting Mr Birling's speech about "a man has to mind his own business" as if it summons the Inspector to disagree with him.
* He is an outsider; he doesn't have much in common with the Birlings.
* he is described as authoritative and imposing. He's not a big man, but his presence "fills the room".
* The Inspector leaves after delivering a speech about social responsibility. When Gerald finds out that the Inspector is probably a fake, the older characters forget his speech and try to avoid the blame once again.
* When he leaves, for a time, there is silence as the characters think over what has been said.

#### Effect on play:
* He starts it all off with a summary of the events of Eva Smith's death.
* He is blunt in the way that he address people and forces information out of people.

#### Language:  
* He uses emotive language.
* He describes Eva Smith as a "pretty" and "lively" girl. These attractive words makes the audience more sympathetic towards her.
* This works on Shelia specifically as she is "rather distressed" by the Inspector's language and says that she "can't help thinking about this girl - destroying herself".  

#### Character:
* He's more than a police inspector, Eric and Shelia realise that his moral judgement is just as important as his legal power.
* He's Priestley's mouthpiece.

#### Quotes:  
* "it’s better to ask for the Earth than to take it"
* "Public men, Mr Birling, have responsibilities as well as privileges"
* "But remember this. One Eva Smith has gone- but there are millions
and millions and millions of Eva Smiths and John Smiths still left with
us, with their lives, their hopes and fears, their suffering and chance of
happiness, all intertwined with our lives, and what we think and say
and do. We don’t live alone. We are members of one body. We are
responsible for each other. And I tell you that the time will soon come
when, if men will not learn that lesson, then they will be taught it in
fire and blood and anguish. Good night."
* "if there’s nothing else we have to share our guilt"


### Arthur Birling:
#### Character:
* He seems very confident and pleased with himself.
* He likes to remind people that he is in charge.
* He sees his daughters engagement as more of a business opportunity for his business.
* The audience sees that his judgement isn't correct, with things like him saying the Titanic won't sink, and that war won't happen ("silly little war scares").
* He is a public figure in Brumley and is obsessed with his status. When his name is at risk of tarnish, he's terrified and would "give thousands" (a bribe) to avoid a scandal.
* He's quite anxious underneath it all; Birling desperately tries to win the Croft's approval by talking about a knighthood and by getting Gerald's father's favourite port.
* Tries to make himself seem more important and intimidating by saying that he plays golf with the Chief Inspector.

#### Language:
* Priestley writes that Birling should be "*provincial in his speech*", which means he has a regional accent. Accent and social class were closely linked, so it would be clear that Birling was a **middle class businessman**.

#### Symbolises:
* The callous and heartlessness of capitalism.

#### Quotes:
* "I’m talking as a hard-headed practical man of business"
* "The Titanic – she sails next week…and unsinkable, absolutely
unsinkable." - shows Mr Birling's complete trust in capitalism.
* "Probably a Socialist or some sort of crank"


### Sybil Birling:  
#### Character:  
* Traditional - "When you're married you'll realize"
* Proud - "I was the only one of you who didn't give in to him"
* Prejudiced - "As if a girl of that sort would ever refuse money"
* Cruel - "I used my influence to have it refused"

* She is Mr Birlings social superior..

* **Mrs Birling doesn't change.**
* She is self-centred; she hasn't noticed her own son's alcoholism and dismisses her daughter's worries that Gerald lost interest last summer.  
* She won't accept responsibility for her actions and claims she did the right thing. - "I accept no blame for it at all"
* She doesn't learn from the inspectors message; she only regrets not having "asked him a few questions".

#### Symbolises:
* All that is wrong with society.
* She represents the social
snobbery and hypocrisy of the
upper classes and shows no
remorse.

#### Quotes:  
* "*About fifty, a rather cold woman and her husband’s social superior*"
* "girls of that class"
* "I’m very sorry. But I think she only had herself to blame" - she's not sorry
* "I’ve done nothing wrong – and you know it."
* "As if a girl of that sort would ever refuse money!"
* "He ought to be dealt with very severely - make sure that he’s compelled to confess in public his responsibility" - doesn't know that its Eric she's talking about.

### Shelia Birling:
#### Character:
* Quick-witted and strong-minded.
* *Was* more selfish the year before (getting Eva Smith fired from Milwards).
* *Now* more sensitive and moral. By the end of the play she has changed for good.
* Has moral standards: she knows what she did was wrong

##### Language makes her seem childish at first:
* Stage directions: "*very pleased with life and rather excited*"
* Uses slang terms, shows that she's from the younger generation.
* Gets ring: "Look mummy, isnt a beauty?"

##### towards the end of the play the audience sees how she's changed:
* Has wise instincts, knows what the inspector is doing.
* Not naive - knows about prostitutes and about dirty old men like Alderman Meggarty.

#### Quotes:
* **Strong minded** - "I don't believe I will. So you be careful"
* **Sharp** - "He's giving us the rope = so that we'll hang ourselves"
* **Selfish** - "You used the power you had […] to punish the girl"
* **Moral** - "But these girls aren't cheap labour - they're people"

### Eric Birling:
#### Character:
* He says that noone understands him.
* Raped Eva Smith.
* Deeply regrets his actions.
* He's the only one that has committed an actual crime.
* Lacks self-control.

#### Quotes:
* **Irresponsible** - "I didn't even remember - that's the hellish thing"
* **Unloved** - "You don't understand anything. You never did."
* **Sensitive** - "My God - I'm not likely to forget"
* **An alcoholic** - "I was in that state when a chap turns nasty"

#### Language:
* Priestley's stage directions say that Eric is "*not quite at ease*".
* Described as being "*half shy*" and "*half assertive*".

### Gerald Croft:
#### Character:
* At first, Gerald seems like a "good fit" for Shelia.
* But then it turns out that he's been lying and that he had an affair with Daisy Renton. Shelia hands the engagement ring back.
* He's the first character to use the word "hoax" - he's very keen to prove the Inspector was a fake.
* He hasn't leant any lessons at the end of the play - "Everything's all right now, Shelia".


#### Quotes:
* **Respectable** - "the easy well-bred young man-about-town"
* **Upper-class** - "landed people and so forth"
* **A liar** - "I wasn't telling you a complete lie"
* **Traditional** - "I should say so!" (Gerald agreeing with Birling)

### Eva Smith/Daisy Renton:
* She never sought revenge, so the Inspector does it for her.

#### Quotes:
* "millions of Eva Smith and John Smiths still left with us" - The Inspector
