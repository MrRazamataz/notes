## The Changing Economic World:  

### Urbanisation:  
* Urbanisation is the growth in the proportion of people living in urban areas.  
* Urbanisation is happening the fastest in poorer countries.  
* Upwards of 55% of the world lives in urban areas, this increases constantly.

### Rate:
* HICs are more economically developed and so most HICs have already experienced urbanisation so around 80% of the population live in urban areas. People leave urban areas for less crowded, rural areas (rate of urbanisation is low).
* LICs are less economically developed. Only around 30% of the population live in urban areas, but have a high rate of urbanisation.
* NEEs are developing economically quickly. The urban population is around 50%+ and the rate of urbanisation is *typically* around 2%.

### Push and Pull factors for Rural-Urban Migration:  
#### Pull:
