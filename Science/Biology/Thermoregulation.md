## Thermoregulation:

### The tempreture of the body should be constant at around 37Â° C.  

To do this, the body has to balance the amount of energy gained, through, for eg, respiration and the amount lost.

In the brain there are receptors that check the blood temp. This is called the **thermoregulatory centre** in the **brain**.

The thermoregulatory centre also receives impulses from temp receptors in the skin with info on skin temp.
